However, how to create vivid photo-realistic images based on exact geometry and optical phenomena is still an essential issue. The authors introduce rendering techniques for visual environmental landscape assessment using computer graphics and/or video sequence images. The techniques are classified into three categories: computer generated images and montages for visualizing landscapes with photo-realistic rendering techniques, panoramic images and panoramic montages employing image-based rendering techniques made from video sequence images, and panned/zoomed video sequence images composited with computer generated images. The basic techniques and their validity are discussed by using practical examples."

This chapter presents an overview of the science process, illustrates examples of the way current approaches to visualization support certain research activities, and suggests a framework by which additional aspects of: (1) science activity, (2) reasoning mode (inference), (3) outcomes, and (4) pre-requisite data and knowledge can be used to better define the role or roles that different visualization tools can play. To bring visualization tools to the fore, it is important to understand clearly the roles that they play within the entire process of scientific investigation including the various tasks that a researcher might undertake and the different kinds of reasoning that the researcher wish visualization to support or enable. The research challenges that are associated with the use and integration of geovisualization tools from a more semantic, process-oriented approach are also summarized. As geovisualization develops, a broader vision is required by which relevant tools and techniques might be orchestrated into something greater than the sum of their parts. This vision is likely to include perspectives from other disciplines and may continue to incorporate techniques and knowledge from cognate fields with expertise in visualization."

  abstract = "The evolution of our understanding of landscape planning and therefore of landscape as a visual resource occurred in parallel with the changes of perception of spatial planning (urban and regional planning), since landscape planning is part of spatial planning. Already in the 1970s the visual landscape was an issue in spatial planning. This can be traced back to the romantic period when the close emotional ties with one’s home country were very important. With the emerging discussion at the end of the 1970s about ecology and ecological planning, more and more the components of natural science of ecological planning were discussed, at the expense of the visual landscape and aesthetics. With the improvement of the possibilities of the digital 3-dimensional (3D) representation of landscape, it seems that landscape as visual resource has once again become more important in the discussion. 3D visualisation will support participation in the planning process and will become an important part of decision support systems in spatial planning. The use of virtual landscapes will help to study processes in the landscape such as fragmentation of landscape and/or urban sprawl."

  abstract = "The development of computer tools for creating and representing virtual worlds has dramatically increased our abilities to capture salient aspects of the environment and communicate them to audiences remote from the landscape under study. The speed and quality of generation of visual imagery, as well as the editing power computers offer, has already dramatically extended the capabilities of practitioners and researchers in representing scenic views. The immersion, motion, and sound offered by virtual worlds may greatly extend the ecological validity of environmental representations and allow for deeper and more meaningful study of the effects of the real world on human experience. However, while the tools are being widely and increasingly adopted, there has been little discussion of the nature of the advantages being gained, nor the cautions that may be necessary. This paper examines the suitability of Virtual Reality (VR) technology for supporting environmental decision-making. We discuss and categorize different aspects of human-computer interfaces and then discuss to what extent the attributes of VR correspond to the needs of landscape representation."

  abstract = {Analysts report spending upwards of 80% of their time on problems in data cleaning. The data cleaning process is inherently iterative, with evolving cleaning workflows that start with basic exploratory data analysis on small samples of dirty data, then refine analysis with more sophisticated/expensive cleaning operators (e.g., crowdsourcing), and finally apply the insights to a full dataset. While an analyst often knows at a logical level what operations need to be done, they often have to manage a large search space of physical operators and parameters. We present Wisteria, a system designed to support the iterative development and optimization of data cleaning workflows, especially ones that utilize the crowd. Wisteria separates logical operations from physical implementations, and driven by analyst feedback, suggests optimizations and/or replacements to the analyst's choice of physical implementation. We highlight research challenges in sampling, in-flight operator replacement, and crowdsourcing. We overview the system architecture and these techniques, then provide a demonstration designed to showcase how Wisteria can improve iterative data analysis and cleaning.

Big data generally refer to massive volumes of data not readily handled by the usual data tools and practices and present unprecedented opportunities for advancing science and informing resource management through data-intensive approaches. The era of big data need not be propelled only by “big science” – the term used to describe large-scale efforts that have had mixed success in the individual-driven culture of ecology. Collectively, ecologists already have big data to bolster the scientific effort – a large volume of distributed, high-value information – but many simply fail to contribute. We encourage ecologists to join the larger scientific community in global initiatives to address major scientific and societal problems by bringing their distributed data to the table and harnessing its collective power. The scientists who contribute such information will be at the forefront of socially relevant science – but will they be ecologists?},

However, these data remain largely inaccessible for a broader segment of users given the computational demands of big data. Climate Engine (http://ClimateEngine.org) is a web-based application that overcomes many computational barriers that users face by employing Google’s parallel cloud-computing platform, Google Earth Engine, to process, visualize, download, and share climate and remote sensing datasets in real time. The software application development and design of Climate Engine is briefly outlined to illustrate the potential for high-performance processing of big data using cloud computing. Second, several examples are presented to highlight a range of climate research and applications related to drought, fire, ecology, and agriculture that can be rapidly generated using Climate Engine. The ability to access climate and remote sensing data archives with on-demand parallel cloud computing has created vast opportunities for advanced natural resource monitoring and process understanding.}",

abstract = {A large and growing body of evidence suggests fundamental changes are needed in transport systems, to tackle issues such as air pollution, physical inactivity and climate change. Transport models can play a major role in tackling these issues through the transport planning process, but they have historically been focussed on motorised modes (especially cars) and available only to professional transport planners working within the existing paradigm. Building on the principles of open access software, first developed in the context of geographic information systems, this paper develops and discusses the concept of open access transport models, which we define as models that are both developed using open source software and are available to be used by the public without the need for specialist training or the purchase of software licences. We explore the future potential of open access transport models to support the transition away from fossil fuels in the transport sector. We do this with reference to the literature on the use of tools in the planning process, and by exploring an example that is already in use: the ‘Propensity to Cycle Tool’. We conclude that open access transport models can be a leverage point in the planning process due to their ability to provide robust, transparent and actionable evidence that is available to a range of stakeholders, not just professional transport planners. Open access transport models represent a disruptive technology deserving further research and development, by planners, researchers and citizen scientists, including open source software developers and advocacy groups but, in order to fulfil their potential, they will require both financial and policy support from government bodies.}

This chapter introduces the Australian Urban Intelligence Network, which brings together a network of researchers, planners and policy-makers from across Australia who have access to an online workbench of data and tools. The workbench comprises over 1100 datasets and 100 spatial statistical routines, and a select number of planning support systems and geodesign tools. In this chapter, we outline the urban data and analytical capability the online workbench; introduce a couple of the PSS tools and spatial statistical capabilities through a case study approach. We also discuss the user outreach and capacity building capability program which is a critical component to assist with user adoption. We conclude the chapter with some reflections on the lessons learnt and next steps in the project.",
